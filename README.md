## Depth-First Search (DFS) for Graph (Revision starts ;))

Follow the steps below to implement DFS on a graph:

1. **Decide the Directions for Traversal:** This could be left to right, top to bottom, etc.

2. **Determine the Starting Point for Traversal:** This could be a specific node or a random node depending on the graph.

3. **Mark the Node as Visited:** Always mark the node as visited in the first step of your DFS.

4. **Create Direction Array:** Depending upon the direction, create a direction array and start the DFS.
